PROJECT: The Pomodoro Clock

    Every week ends with a project you have to build on your own. Instead of getting clear-cut instructions, you'll get a list of criteria that your project needs to measure up to.

    Write the project code in the folder Week2 \ project.

In this week's project you'll be making a Pomodoro Clock! A user can specify how many minutes the timer should be set, and with a click on the play button it starts counting down! If the user wants to pause the timer, they can do so by clicking the pause button.

It should look like this:

Pomodoro Clock

Here are the requirements:

    If the timer is running, the user can't change the session length anymore
    Use at least 3 functions
    Display minutes and seconds
    If the timer finishes the timer should be replaced by the message: Time's up!
